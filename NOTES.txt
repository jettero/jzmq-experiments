- the auth thread only picks up certs at the start. If you later copy a
  cert into the keyring, the auth thread won't recognize it.
  - do we just restart the auth thread?
  - restart the daemon when add certs? ...
  - there's gotta be some way to rescan

- when jzmq.jsmb.cmd receives a line of input, what should happen?
  - we'll need a decentralized infrastructure to talk about this I guess
  - in "A → B", say the arrow indicates A connecting to B, which implies
    all the channels we expect in the StupidNode object... A will subscribe
    to B's PUB socket, A's PUSH socket will connect to B's PULL socket,
    etc.
  - So, in our test architecture, let's have 5 nodes (A-E), each connected to two
    others and try to come up with as much path variety as possible... hrm.
    - We definitely want to see graph cycles
    - and symmetry (A→B, B→A)
    - and "Isolated" nodes: meaning if they PUBlish, there's no subscribers
    - I think this pretty good according to the above:
      A → B, A → C
      B → C, B → D
      D → A, D → B
      E → D, E → C
