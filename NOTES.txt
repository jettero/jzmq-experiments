- the auth thread only picks up certs at the start. If you later copy a
  cert into the keyring, the auth thread won't recognize it.
  - do we just restart the auth thread?
  - restart the daemon when add certs? ...
  - there's gotta be some way to rescan

- when jzmq.cmd receives a line of input, what should happen?
  - we'll need a decentralized infrastructure to talk about this I guess
  - in "A → B", say the arrow indicates A connecting to B
  - So, in our test architecture, let's have 5 nodes (A,…,E), each
    connected to two others and try to come up with as much path variety as
    possible... hrm.
    - We definitely want to see graph cycles
    - and symmetry (A→B, B→A)
    - and "Isolated" nodes: meaning if they PUBlish, there's no subscribers
    - I think this pretty good according to the above:
      TEST_ARCH    A → B, A → C
      TEST_ARCH    B → C, B → D
      TEST_ARCH    C → A, C → D
      TEST_ARCH    D → A, D → B
      TEST_ARCH    E → C
    - let's write some tests…
      - we'll have MSG(source:target0,target1) mean
        source->publish_message() should reach nodes target0 and target1
      - TEST_ARCH: MSG(A:B,C,D,E)
      - TEST_ARCH: MSG(B:A,C,D,E)
      - TEST_ARCH: MSG(E:A,B,C,D)
