[x] prevent routing loops — I think we got this
[ ] routed messages should queue at the src until the destination receives
    them or the sender gets tired of waiting. currently, if we can find no
    route, we eventually discards (which is ok); but if we have a route
    that doesn't work — we send the message and expect the next hop to
    handle the queueing. The only way to queue locally and discard there is
    if the next hop happens to be the destination and it's not actually
    there.
[ ] we need some kind of reverse routing … in a network on a stick,
    a>b>c>d>e we can route from e>>a but routes from a>>e will always fail
    because we don't ever attempt to route messages back up the dealer
    socket. Some of the framework is already there though. nonlocal_react
    invokes routed_react when it receives a routed message. This is meant
    to facilitate sending the message up the dealer hole.
[ ] we need some way to invalidate routes
[ ] we need a routing table so we can try alternate routes of we learn one
    doesn't work (see invalidate above). With this, we could also order
    known routes in shortest first fashion.
